salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste

Stir in flour, salt, oil, oregano, and parsley. May need to add a tiny bit more water if it's too dry.
Beat until smooth. Let rest for 5 minutes.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a round.
Transfer crust to a lightly greased pizza pan or baker's peel dusted with cornmeal.
Spread with desired toppings.  Brush with baking soda/hot water mixture and sprinkle with salt.
