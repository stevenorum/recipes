## Ingredients

### For step 2
* 2 teaspoons active dry yeast
* 1 teaspoon white sugar
* 1 1/2 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C, or hot enough that you wouldn't want to hang out in a hottub that temperature, but not hot enough to burn your finger if you hold it in the water for 15+ seconds. Err on the side of being too cold, as too hot will kill the yeast)

* 2 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 1/2 teaspoon salt
* oregano
* parsley
