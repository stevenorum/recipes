Ingredients
4 teaspoons active dry yeast
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)

3 cups bread flour
1/4 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon salt
oregano
parsley

1/2 cup baking soda
4 cups hot water
1/4 cup kosher salt, for topping

Directions

Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water.
Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
Stir in flour, salt, oil, oregano, and parsley. May need to add a tiny bit more water if it's too dry.
Beat until smooth. Let rest for 5 minutes.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a round.
Transfer crust to a lightly greased pizza pan or baker's peel dusted with cornmeal.
Spread with desired toppings.  Brush with baking soda/hot water mixture and sprinkle with salt.
Bake in preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown.
Let baked pizza cool for 5 minutes before serving.
