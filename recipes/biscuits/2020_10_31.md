# Biscuits, the way I actually make them

## Ingredients

* 2 cups all-purpose flour 
* 1 tablespoon baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 cup shortening
* ~1/4 cup butter and/or margarine
* 3/4 cup milk

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
2. In a large mixing bowl sift together flour, baking powder and salt. Cut in shortening+butter with fork or pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. You can vary the ratio of butter and shortening depending on your preferred flavor - they both contribute to the flakiness, but the butter also, well, make them taste like butter.
3. Pour milk into flour mixture while stirring with a fork. Mix in milk until dough is soft, moist and pulls away from the side of the bowl.
4. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and toss with flour until no longer sticky. Roll dough out into a 1/2 inch thick sheet and cut with a floured biscuit or cookie cutter. Press together unused dough and repeat rolling and cutting procedure. For the last couple, just shape the dough into biscuit-sized flat rounds. They won't raise quite the same due to the edges not having been cut, but they'll be good enough.
5. Place biscuits on ungreased baking sheets and bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes.
