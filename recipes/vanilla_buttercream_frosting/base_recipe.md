## Vanilla buttercream frosting

From [Sally's Baking Addiction](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/vanilla-buttercream/)

### Ingredients

* 1 cup (230g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
* 4 – 5 cups (480-600g) confectioners’ sugar (see note)
* 1/4 cup (60ml) heavy cream, half-and-half, or whole milk, at room temperature
* 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
* salt, to taste

### Instructions

1. With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. 
2. Add 4 and 1/2 cups confectioners’ sugar, the heavy cream, and vanilla extract. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to medium-high speed and beat for 2 full minutes. 
3. Taste. Add a pinch of salt if frosting is too sweet. I always add 1/8 teaspoon.
4. Adjust if needed: You can control the consistency at this point– add up to 1/2 cup more confectioners’ sugar if frosting is too thin or more heavy cream if frosting is too thick (add only 1 Tablespoon at a time, beat together, then taste and add more if desired).
