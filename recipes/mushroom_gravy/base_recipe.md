# [Mushroom Gravy, from New York Times](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017760-vegan-mushroom-make-ahead-gravy)

Slightly modified to remove onion and increase the flavor.

## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 tablespoon of fresh finely-chopped rosemary. Not sure how much you should use if you're using dried.
* 12 ounces mushrooms, finely chopped (I normally use 4 ounces of shiitake or other fancy mushrooms and 8 ounces of white mushrooms)
* 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
* 3 to 4 cups vegetable stock, preferably homemade, as needed
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce, more to taste
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper

## Instructions

1. In a large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add rosemary, then cook for a few minutes, stirring occasionally. I normally start this right before chopping (well, food processing) the mushrooms
2. Add the mushrooms; cook, stirring, until well browned, 8 to 10 minutes.
3. Sprinkle in flour and cook, stirring, until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. 
4. Slowly whisk in vegetable stock, a little at a time, until a smooth sauce forms.
5. Simmer 2 to 3 minutes until thickened. 
6. Season with soy sauce, salt and pepper. 
7. Serve as is.
