## Pizza crust dough, lower-gluten, based very loosely on [this King Arthuer recipe](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/neapolitan-style-pizza-crust-recipe)

### Ingredients
* 1 tsp active dry yeast
* 1 tsp white sugar
* 1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 cup cake flour
* 2 tsp salt

### Directions
* Put your pizza stone or steel on the highest or second-highest rack in your oven.  Preheat to 425 (or more).
* In a medium bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. 
* Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
* Stir in flour and salt. 
* Beat until smooth, then split into two balls (this'll make two large-personal pizzas).
* Let rest for 5 minutes and rise for as long as you've got (up to overnight).
* Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a round. 
* Transfer crust to a piece of aluminum foil dusted with flour. 
* Spread with desired toppings and bake in preheated oven until golden and crispy. On a 400 degree pizza stone in a 425 degree oven, this takes about 15-20 minutes, depending on the toppings and how thick you made the crust.
* Let baked pizza cool for 5 minutes before serving.
