## Homemade Hot Pockets/Calzones (20180325 version)

### Ingredients

#### CRUST (DRY)
* 4 cups flour
* 1/3 cup sugar
* 1 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 1/2 tbsp yeast
* 1 tbsp [basic italian seasoning](https://github.com/stevenorum/recipes/blob/master/recipes/italian%20seasoning/20180319.txt)
* 1 tsp [rosemary-heavy italian seasoning](https://github.com/stevenorum/recipes/blob/master/recipes/italian%20seasoning/20180319.txt)

#### CRUST (WET)
* 1/4 cup olive oil
* 1 1/2 cups warm water

#### FILLINGS
* Shredded cheddar and/or mozzarella cheese
* Diced veggies
* Diced meat (real or fake)
* Spices, maybe?
* Really, this part is entirely up to you.
* Toss in some styrofoam and gravel for all I care.
* Whatever floats your goat.

### Instructions

1. Mix all the dry crust stuff.
2. Pour in the water and oil.
3. Mix it all up.  Will need to switch to kneading at some point.
4. Cover with a damp towel and let rise until doubled in size.
5. Go watch an episode of NCIS or something.
6. Divide into 8-16 sections (depending on desired size) and roll into flat, vaguely circular shapes.
7. Put stuff in 'em.
8. Fold in half and seal edges.  Wetting the dough where it's being sealed will really help them stay shut while cooking but isn't strictly required.
9. Bake at 450F for 14 minutes.
10. Let cool a bit.
11. Wrap in tin foil.
12. Freeze.

### Reheating
Nuke in a paper towel for ~2 minutes, or 3+ if your microwave is as old and busted as mine.
