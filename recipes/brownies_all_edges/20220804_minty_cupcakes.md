# Brownies

This is the recipe, with mint extract added, and in cupcake tins.

## Ingredients

* 240 g Smart Balance (just because it's what I usually have on hand). This is 12 heaping tbsp, or about 17 tbsp according to their nutrition facts that say 1 tbsp = 14 grams.
* 6 oz unsweetened chocolate, or a bar and a half of the Ghirardelli 100% cacao. I've also bumped this up to 2 whole bars (8 oz) before.
* 2 1/4 cups white sugar, or 2 1/2 - 3 cups if you're using 8 oz of chocolate.
* 3 eggs
* 1 - 1.5 tbsp vanilla extract (in most recipes, I double the amount of vanilla the original calls for and it's a noticeable improvement)
* 1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 cup chocolate chips
* 8ml-32ml mint extract - depends on how minty you want it.

## Instructions

1. Preheat over to 350F and lightly spray tins with nonstick cooking spray. I usually fill 20-24 cupcake cups.
2. Place the unsweetened chocolate and butter in a double boiler (or, in my case, a bowl over a pot of simmering water). Stir until it's all a homogenous mixture.
3. Stir in the sugar. 
4. Stir in the eggs, one at a time.
5. Stir in the vanilla extract. 
6. Stir in the flour and salt, mixing just until combined. 
7. Stir in the chocolate chips. 
8. Spread the batter into the prepared tins.
9. Bake for about 25-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the brownie comes out with moist crumbs.
