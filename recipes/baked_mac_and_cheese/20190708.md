Based on [this recipe from epicurious.com](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/member/views/smoked-gouda-mac-and-cheese-51526451) and [this recipe from boarshead.com](https://boarshead.com/recipes/detail/1581808522-smoked-gouda-mac-cheese)

## Ingredients

* 2 pounds (dry) pasta (this time, using shells, but elbows or other types also work)
* 1/2 cup butter
* 4 cups milk (may need to bump up to 8, we'll see)
* 2 pounds roughly-grated cheese (using a mix of Welsh cheddar, smoked cheddar, sharp cheddar, and smoked gouda)
* 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
* 2 tsp salt
* 2 tsp ground black pepper
* 2 tsp paprika
* Large baking pan (really large)

## Instructions
1. Cook the pasta.
1. Preheat oven to 400F.
1. Melt butter in a saucepan over low-medium heat.  Once liquid, add the flour and whisk well.
1. Once that's all well-combined, add the milk.  Start with 4 cups.
1. Lower the heat to low, warm, or off.  (If the cheese gets too hot, it starts to break down, and you want to avoid that.)
1. Once that's all hot, start mixing in the cheese (save 1-2 cups).  If it gets too thick to flow well, but it's all melted, add more milk.
1. Put the pasta into the big baking pan (9x13x3 or bigger, or two 8x12x2).
1. Pour the cheese mixture over the pasta.
1. Sprinkle the last of the cheese on top.
1. Bake for 20-30 minutes, until the top is bubbly and/or maybe just starting to brown the slightest bit.
1. Devour.
