## Crepes

Based on [AllRecipes Basic Crepes](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/16383/basic-crepes/), but slightly modified to fit the ingredients I have on hand and to (I think) turn out a bit better.

### Ingredients
* 1 cup flour
* 2 eggs
* 1 cup almond milk
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 2 tablespoons butter

### Instructions

1. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together all of the wet ingredients. Mix in the salt, then sift in the flour while mixing continuously to prevent lumps.
2. Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.
3. Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.
