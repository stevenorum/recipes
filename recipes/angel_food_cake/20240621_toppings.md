# Cherry sauce
From [Natasha's Kitchen](https://www.justtherecipe.com/?url=https://natashaskitchen.com/cherry-sauce-recipe/).

## Ingredients
* 1 quart pitted sweet cherries
* 1/3 cup water
* 1 tbsp corn starch
* 1 tbsp fresh lemon juice
* 2 tbsp white sugar

## Instructions
1. In a saucepan, combine water, cornstarch, lemon juice, and sugar until mixed.
2. Heat on medium and whisk constantly until the mixture starts to thicken around the bottom.
3. Add the cherries and cook stirring occasionally until sauce is simmering and bubbling.
4. Lower the heat and cook a bit longer if you want. The longer it cooks, the more liquid will evaporate, and the thicker it'll be.
5. Cool enough to put in a container, then refrigerate until needed.
