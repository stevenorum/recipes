## Allium-free barbecue sauce

Pretty much all barbecue sauce has garlic and/or onion in it, which makes it delicious, but also makes it inedible to people who have an allium intolerance (which thankfully doesn't include me but unfortunately does include the missus). So, I pieced together a recipe that tastes okay and is safe.

I used [this addapinch.com recipe](https://addapinch.com/homemade-bbq-sauce-recipe/) and [this allrecipes.com recipe](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/51226/a-very-popular-bbq-sauce/) as inspirations, but didn't follow either of them all that closely.

Because I'm still experimenting with this one, I made a 3-cup batch of the base, then split it into 4 jars and added different final flavorings to each one.

### Ingredients

#### Base ingredients:

* 1 cup tomato paste
* 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
* 1/2 cup water
* 1/2 cup soy sauce
* 1/4 cup honey
* 1/4 cup molasses
* 1/4 cup dark brown sugar

For the soy sauce, I used mostly Chinese with a touch of Japanese, as we had a nearly-empty bottle of each in the fridge and a new bottle of Chinese in the cupboard. I'm not sure how much it'll make a difference to the final taste. You could probably also use liquid aminos, or some other source of salt and savoriness (Worcestershire sauce is a common one, but as it contains both allium and fish (and I'm vegetarian), it makes no sense whatsoever in our case).

#### Final flavorings:

The quantities listed here are for mixing with 1/4 of the base (about 6 oz). I used one in each jar and left one jar as just the base; as we use it I'll mix them together to find our preferred final ratio. It's easy to taste it as you add these and adjust as you see fit. Just make sure to stir really well after adding each one so that it gets evenly mixed in.

* 1 tsp yellow mustard
* 1/2 tsp fresh-ground black pepper
* 1/2 tsp smoked paprika

### Instructions

1. Mix all the non-sugar base ingredients in a pot over low-medium heat. (The heat is probably not strictly necessary and I didn't let it get to boiling.)
2. Once those are all evenly mixed, add in all the sugars (honey, molasses, dark brown sugar).
3. Take it off the heat and split it into 4 1-cup jars (or not, if you just want one variety).
4. Flavor each jar as desired, and mix well.
5. Refrigerate. I just made it a few hours ago, so I have no idea how long it'll last.
