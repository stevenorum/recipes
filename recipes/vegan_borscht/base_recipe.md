## Ingredients

* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 3 medium beets, peeled and diced (1/2 inch)
* 2 medium carrots, peeled and diced (1/2 inch)
* 1 medium onion, chopped
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 4 cups vegetable broth
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* 2 cups finely chopped cabbage
* 1 medium russet potato, peeled and diced (1/2 inch)
* 1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice
* 1/4 cup chopped fresh dill, plus more for serving
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Vegan sour cream, yogurt, or cashew cream, for serving
* Chopped fresh chives and/or parsley, for serving

## Instructions
1. Coat the bottom of a large pot with olive oil and place it over medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the beets, carrot and onions. Sauté until the veggies begin to soften, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and sauté another minute, until very fragrant.

1. Stir in the broth, tomato paste, cabbage and potato. Raise the heat and bring the liquid to a boil. Lower the heat and allow to simmer, uncovered, until the veggies are tender, 15-20 minutes. You can add more broth or water if you like.

1. Remove the pot from heat and stir in the lemon juice and dill. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

1. Ladle the soup into bowls and top with vegan sour cream, yogurt, or cashew cream, and a sprinkling of fresh dill, parsley and/or chives. Serve.
