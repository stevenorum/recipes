## Candied strawberry slices

From [One Sweet Appetite](https://onesweetappetite.com/candy-strawberries/)

### Ingredients

* 1/2 cup water
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 1 pint strawberries

### Instructions

1. (Make simple syrup) Combine half of a cup of sugar with half of a cup of water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil. Once the sugar has dissolved completely, take the pan off of the heat and allow it to cool to room temperature.
2. Wash and hull your strawberries. Slice each berry as thin as you can get it. Dip into your cooled syrup and place on a parchment lined baking pan.
3. Bake at 200 degrees for up to 3 hours. I recommend checking on your berries every hour to see their progress. You want them dry, but still red.
