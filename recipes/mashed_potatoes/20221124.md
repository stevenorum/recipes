# Mashed Potatoes

## Ingredients
* 6.5 pounds of potatoes. I used about 5.5-6 pounds of russets, peeled (prior to weighing), and 3 red potatoes (unpeeled) to give the resulting mashed potatoes a bit of visual flair.
* 1/2 cup butter
* 1 cup milk
* 1 tablespoon salt

## Instructions
1. Peel the potatoes and cut them into chunks.
2. Boil a bunch of water.
3. Mix the salt into the water.
4. Put the potatoes into the water.
5. Boil until tender, 10-15 minutes.
6. Take them out of the water (with a slotted spoon or strainer or whatever your preferred method is).
7. Melt the butter into the milk in the microwave, or on the stovetop if you're super fancy.
8. Mash the potatoes as much as possible, then mix in the milk/butter and mash a bit more, then stir with a spoon.
9. Add salt to taste. Garlic would also probably be great, but as the missus is intolerant, I leave it out.
