Makes 8 large plain bagels

## Ingredients

* 500 grams (3 ½ cups) bread flour 
* 12 grams (1 ½ tablespoons) sugar 
* 1 gram (1/4 teaspoon) active dry yeast
* 16 grams (1 tablespoon) fine sea salt
* 300 grams (1 1/4 cup) water, 105 degrees F
* 2 Tbsp Baking Soda
* 2 Tbsp Honey (sugar, molasses, malt, etc)- OPTIONAL

## Instructions

### Day 1
1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, yeast and salt.
2. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the water. Mix with a wooden spoon to just combine, then knead the dough by hand on a lightly floured countertop or cutting board for about 5 minutes, until it is smooth and elastic. 
3. Put the dough in bowl and cover with a clean, damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap. Allow to rise for 24 hours at room temperature, or until the dough has  just about doubled in size.

### Day 2
1. Preheat your oven to 425 degrees F for 45-60 minutes with your Baking Steel inside. 
2. Punch the dough down, and let it rest for another 10 minutes. 
3. Divide the dough into 8 equal portions. Form dough into balls.
4. Coat a finger in flour, and poke a hole into the center of each dough ball, gently stretching the hole with your fingers to form a traditional bagel shape.
5. After shaping the dough rounds and placing them on a piece of parchment paper, cover with a damp kitchen towel and allow to rest for 10 minutes. 
6. Bring a large pot of water (feel free to add a little honey) to a boil with sweetener and baking soda. Use a slotted spoon or skimmer to lower the bagels into the water. Boil for about 1 minute; the bagels will rise in the water and may bob on top. Using the slotted spoon, remove the bagels, tap to remove excess water, and transfer to a piece of parchment paper or directly onto a sheet tray that has been lightly dusted with semolina flour. If you’d like to add seeds or toppings to your bagels, now is the time: right after boiling is when they will be “stickiest” and best able to hold onto them. 
7. Either place your parchment onto a sheet tray and place on your Baking Steel, or use a pizza peel to launch the parchment sheet directly onto your Steel.
8. Bake for 14-18 minutes, rotating halfway through baking, or until golden brown. Remove and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. 
9. Cool completely and make sure you have some soft cream cheese around. Store in an airtight container for 3-5 days, or freeze for up to 1 month.
