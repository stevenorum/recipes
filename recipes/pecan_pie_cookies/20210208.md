# Pecan Pie Cookies

## Ingredients

* 2 cups dark brown sugar
* 1 cup salted butter, softened/room temperature
* 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
* 2 large eggs
* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 1/2 cups pecan halves
* 1 cup dark chocolate chips

## Supplies
* Large mixing bowl
* 1 cup measuring cup
* 1/2 cup measuring cup
* 1 tablespoon measuring spoon
* 1/2 teaspoon measuring spoon
* Mixing spoon
* Baking sheet
* Parchment paper
* Tub for refrigerating dough

## Instructions
 
1. In a large mixing bowl, mix brown sugar, butter and vanilla until light and fluffy.
2. Add eggs and mix.
3. Add flour, salt and baking soda and mix.
4. Stir in pecans and chocolate chips.
5. Refrigerate dough for 30+ minutes. Will last at least a day or two in the fridge, but I don't know for sure how long.
5. Preheat oven to 350Â°F.
6. Line cookie sheet with parchment paper.
7. Put cookie dough on the sheet. One standard spoon's worth of dough seems to work, rolled into a ball. The cookies will spread out quite a bit, so make sure to space them outroll cookies into 1.25" balls or use a cookie scoop to make dough balls and drop at least 3" apart onto cookie sheet. Bake 8 minutes.
7. Optional: using a salt grinder, add a crack of sea salt on top just after pulling them out of the oven.
8. Allow to cool 1 minute. Transfer to a wire cooling rack and allow to cool completely.
