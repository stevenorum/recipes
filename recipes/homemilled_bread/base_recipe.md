## Bread made from home-milled flour on 21 May 2023

Rough source (I changed a few things but mostly followed this): [Fresh Milled Mama](https://freshmilledmama.com/basic-bread-recipe-with-fresh-milled-flour/#wprm-recipe-container-645)

### Ingredients
* 1.5 cups warm water under 110°F so you don't kill yeast
* 1/3 cup olive oil
* 1/3 cup + 2 tbsp molasses (replacing 1/3 cup honey in the original recipe because I'm out of basic honey)
* 1 tbsp yeast
* 2 tsp salt
* 2 tbsp gluten (replacing 1 tsp in the original recipe because I misread tsp and tbsp and also guessed that it'd be better with a bit extra)
* 5 cups fresh milled flour from brewing-type white wheat malt (plus extra for kneading)
* I also used 1/4-1/2 cup of fresh milled rye flour (again from rye malt meant for brewing) as I ran out of the white wheat flour while my hands were dirty from kneading and I didn't feel like milling more

I left out the 1 tbsp sunflower lecithin powder and 1/8 tsp vitamin c (ascorbic acid) powder as I don't keep either of those on hand.

### Instructions

1. Combine water, oil, molasses, and yeast. I recommend adding the molasses, water, and yeast first and mixing all that together, then mixing in the oil a few minutes later so the yeast has had a chance to really dissolve into the sugary water. Let proof for 10-15 minutes.
2. Add gluten, salt, and half (approximate) of the flour. Mix and add the rest of the flour as you get everything fully mixed. I had to add extra flour, possibly due to using molasses instead of honey (as it's a bit more liquid). Just add until it's a normal bread-dough-like consistency, with just a bit of stickiness. I added until there was no stickiness and that was likely a bit too much flour. The original recipe calls for using a dough hook, but if I'm milling my own flour at home, it's at least a little bit practicing for TEOTWAWKI and I don't expect I'll want to waste electricity on something I can do by hand in that situation.
3. Let rise in an oiled bowl covered with plastic wrap, loose fitting lid, or a dish towel until double in size. About an hour.
4. Punch down dough and shape.
5. Place in desired loaf pans, cover and do the second rise. (until doubled; about an hour)
6. Bake at 375°F for 25-30 minutes. (internal temp of 190°F)
7. Remove from pan and cool on a wire rack. If you don't do this step it will be soggy.
