# Vegetable broth

I always have to make this from scratch because I'm vegetarian and my girlfriend is allargic to allium (garlic and onions), so there's literally no off-the-shelf broth that we can both consume.

## Ingredients

* Cabbage
* Potatoes
* Sweet potatoes
* Mushrooms
* Turnip
* Carrots
* Celery
* Peppercorns
* Water
* Big-ass pot

## Instructions
1. Chop up everything listed above, except for the water (although you can try if you'd like) and the pot (likewise, you can try, but your knife would rather you not).
1. Put all of it except for the pot into the pot.
1. Heat it up to a low boil, so that it's constantly moving a bit but isn't at risk of boiling over.
1. Go for a run or whatever you do when you've got a couple hours to kill.
1. Done.
