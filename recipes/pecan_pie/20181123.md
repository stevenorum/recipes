## Thanksgiving 2018
* I often double this and make two pies.
* When I make this, I aim for it to be far more filling-dense than a traditional pecan pie.  Instead of being a layer of pecans over an egg/milk/sugar/vanilla custard (for lack of a better term), I much prefer consistent mixture of custard/pecan/chocolate chips.

## Ingredients

* 1 cup dark brown sugar
* 1/4 cup white sugar
* 1/2 cup fake butter
* 2 eggs
* 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
* 1 tablespoon soy milk
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 1 or 2 cups chopped pecans
* 1 cup dark chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).
1. In a large bowl, beat eggs until foamy, and stir in melted butter. 
1. Stir in the brown sugar, white sugar and the flour; mix well. 
1. Stir in the milk and vanilla.
1. Add the nuts and chocolate chips.
1. Pour into an unbaked 9-in pie shell. 
1. Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes at 400 degrees, then reduce temperature to 350 degrees and bake for 30 to 40 minutes, until the top starts to brown and crack.
