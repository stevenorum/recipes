# [Crescent Rolls from Taste of Home](https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/buttery-crescent-rolls/)

This is a slight modification on that recipe, based on other roll recipes I've seen.

## Ingredients

* 2 tablespoons active dry yeast
* 3 ounces sugar
* 1 cup warm milk (100° to 110°) (I actually used 1/2 cup whole milk and 1/2 cup half&half because I only had half a cup of milk left)
* 1/2 cup butter, softened
* 1 ounce butter, melted
* 1 egg, room temperature
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 16-17 ounces (weight, not volume) all-purpose flour, plus more for kneading and the like

## Instructions

1. Dissolve yeast and sugar in milk, and let sit for ten minutes.
2. Mix in the softened butter, egg, and salt.
3. Mix in the flour and mix until there aren't any clumps of dry powder left.
4. Knead until it's a smooth dough.
5. Cover and let rise in a dark, warm place for an hour.
6. Punch dough down and divide into 12 units. Roll each one as thin as possible, brush with melted butter, and roll up.
7. Curve into a crescent shape and place on a greased baking sheet.
8. Cover and let rise for 30 minutes in a dark, warm place. I recommend preheating the oven early and leaving it on top.
9. Uncover and bake at 350F until golden-brown, 10-12 minutes.
